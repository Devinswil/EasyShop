## Description of the Project

As an application developer, my role extends beyond writing my own code to include improving and optimizing preexisting code. Within this application, I enhanced existing code to improve its functionality and resolved bugs that impeded performance. This effort culminated in delivering a fully functional API and a robust front-end store, ensuring seamless integration and a better user experience. 

## User Stories
- As a user I would like to be able to get all categories.
- As the ADMIN I would like to be able to delete categories.
- As the user I would like to be able to get category by id.
- As the user I would like to be able to get all products.
- As the Amin I would like to be able to insert products into the database.
- As the admin I would like to be able to delete products from the database.
- As the admin I would like to update products.
- As the user I would like to be able to get products by Id.
- As the ADMIN I would like to be able to update categories.
- As the ADMIN I would like to be able to add a category into the database.
- As the user I would like to be able to run the API without having any bug.

## Setup

- Run Capstone starter
- Refresh database in SQL
- Run Web application

### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
